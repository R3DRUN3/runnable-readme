## Abstract
*Runnable Readme* is a simple utility that allows people to execute bash commands that are found in *README* (markdown) files in automatic fashion.
<br/>
The advantage is twofold:
1. Allow those who follow a documentation to avoid tedious copy-paste.
2. Encourage developers to write documentation that is as clear and reproducible as possible.

We can call this *Documentation as Code* üòä

test it against a *markdown* file:
